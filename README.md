# Dengue-Prediction

## Introducion
This project is based on the [TensorFlow Time Series tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series).
The goals was to predict the dengue case count in Singapore by regions (North, South, East, West).

## Model
A simple LSTM model with a single layer is used with MSE as loss. 

## Code
- Weather data web scrapping in R
- [RNN Model in Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FFfHaJ2j9jB7ksCHW1FPuTEiMX1ABv2b)
